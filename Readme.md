In the current iteration this repository is used for three different tasks.

1. Swimsim, similation of 1D movement of fish in the river on the migration to the ocean
2. Preparing semi-realistic movement of a sitckleback in a tank. It is used in blender and the most recent working code is copied into another repo: https://github.com/mixmixmix/blendthemovement
3. 2d overhead movement of little isopod-like alfs (alien life forms) that create a toy example for animal tracking.


Examples:
```
python move_alfs.py --ddir threealfs --datapoints 10000
```
